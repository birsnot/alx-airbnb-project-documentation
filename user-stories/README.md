# User Stories

This document contains user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone project backend. Each user story outlines a core interaction that a user or administrator may have with the system, written from the perspective of the end-user.

## Purpose

User stories help to:
- Define the system's expected functionality in simple, user-centered language.
- Guide development by clarifying what features are needed and why.
- Ensure the backend supports a seamless experience for both guests and hosts.

## File Structure

- `user-stories.md`: Contains at least five user stories related to essential features such as user registration, property management, booking, payments, and reviews.

## Example User Story Format

**As a [type of user],
I want to [perform an action],
So that [I can achieve a goal or benefit].**


## Usage

This file serves as a reference for developers and stakeholders to understand the core functionalities from the user's perspective. It supports iterative development and testing by providing a clear baseline for expected behavior.
