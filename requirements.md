# Backend Feature Requirements

This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for key backend features of the Airbnb Clone project, including API design, data validation, and performance expectations.

## 1. User Authentication

### Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to register, log in, and log out securely.
- Sessions should be maintained using JWT.
- Passwords must be hashed and securely stored.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description            |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/register`  | Register a new user    |
| POST   | `/api/login`     | Authenticate user      |
| GET    | `/api/logout`    | Log out current user   |
| GET    | `/api/profile`   | Get user profile info  |

### Input Specifications

**POST `/api/register`**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "guest"
}
````

### Output Specifications

**Success (200)**

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "token": "jwt-token"
}
```

### Validation Rules

* Email must be valid and unique.
* Password must be at least 8 characters.
* Role must be either `guest` or `host`.

### Performance Criteria

* Response time should be under 200ms.
* Token generation and validation should use industry standards (e.g., HMAC SHA256).

## 2. Property Management

### Functional Requirements

* Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
* Listings include details such as location, price, availability, and amenities.
* Guests can view and search listings.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                   |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/properties`     | Create a new property listing |
| GET    | `/api/properties`     | List all properties           |
| GET    | `/api/properties/:id` | Get single property details   |
| PUT    | `/api/properties/:id` | Update property information   |
| DELETE | `/api/properties/:id` | Delete a property             |

### Input Specifications

**POST `/api/properties`**

```json
{
  "title": "Beachside Bungalow",
  "location": "Malibu",
  "price": 120,
  "amenities": ["Wi-Fi", "Pool"],
  "availability": ["2025-06-01", "2025-06-15"]
}
```

### Output Specifications

**Success (201)**

```json
{
  "message": "Property created successfully",
  "propertyId": "abc123"
}
```

### Validation Rules

* Title must not be empty.
* Price must be a positive number.
* Availability must be a valid date array.

### Performance Criteria

* Property creation and retrieval should complete within 300ms.
* Paginate property listings for large datasets.

## 3. Booking System

### Functional Requirements

* Guests can book available properties for specific dates.
* System must prevent double bookings.
* Bookings can be canceled based on rules.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint            | Description             |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/bookings`     | Create a new booking    |
| GET    | `/api/bookings`     | List user bookings      |

}
```

### Output Specifications

**Success (201)**

```json
{
  "message": "Booking confirmed",
  "bookingId": "xyz456"
}
```

### Validation Rules

* Dates must not overlap with existing bookings.
* Start date must be before end date.
* Property must exist and be available.

### Performance Criteria

* Booking confirmation should complete under 400ms.
* Concurrent booking attempts must be locked to prevent race conditions.

## Notes

* All endpoints must return proper HTTP status codes (`200`, `201`, `400`, `401`, `404`, etc.).
* Authentication required for all POST/PUT/DELETE routes.
* Use pagination and filtering for all `GET` list endpoints.
